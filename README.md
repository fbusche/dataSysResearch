Will probably be getting rid of this repo later, but for now this is where my code will go.

This entire thing at the moment is just creating a wallet that:
- Makes a minimal wallet in C++
- Aims first for minimal functions so that I then have a benchmark 
- Doesn't need to support multiple wallets, so if one already exists then refuse to create a new one (can delete and make another tho?)
- Send transactions from you to someone else, check balance, etc.
- At some point later on we'll need to confirm to see that it is complete
- In this sense it might be good to have a list of transaction history (see that it's successful and verified)
